# StatePopulations
United STates Population Estimates, 2019

This map depicts population estimates for the United States using perceptual circle scaling. The purpose is to demonstrate comparisons between state population sizes. For example, by reading this map, it is clear that California, Texas, and Florida have some of the largest population sizes in the US, while Montana and New Mexico have small population sizes, especially relative to the size of the state. Population size is depicted using varying sizes of orange circles. Larger circles represent larger population sizes, while smaller circles represent smaller populations. Users can interact with this map by putting their mouse over a circle to turn the circle blue. 

Data displayed on this map comes from the US Census Bureau Estimates. To create this map, this data was converted into a geoJSON format using geoJSON.io. Coding and testing was completed through Atom. This map was created by Jess McClelland for GHY3814 through the Appalachian State University Geography Department on November 13th, 2020.
